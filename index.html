    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/image1.jpg" alt="an image of a aurora">

<p>Hello there and welcome to my "about me" page that I created, in here you'll find every reason
why I would be an asset to you. I'm your usual persistent everyday person who hates leaving things undone, 
I cannot leave a task until I feel satisfied with the results and well im just simply stubborn on reaching as close
as possible to perfection with my work. Hopefully that's the type of guy your looking for in your work place.</p>

<p>I went a little straight to the point but I always prefer to cut to the chase.
 The type of job experiences that I had in my past can most likely benefit you in your company as well. 
 I've been a manager for a small smoothie joint called Boba at Avetura Mall in Aventura FL for about 3 years
 I would say and I can tell you that it has taught me leadership skills, managing people is never an easy task.
 That job gave me a strong sense of responsibility, I needed to make sure we always had all the materials necessary to keep the business running in a smoothly fashion. I also obtained another job at Metro PCS
 as a sales rep in Miami FL, that job it's where my love for phones and tech in general 
 was born. We would have early hands on tech before it got released to the public and had early training on all these new phones before selling them so we knew what features to highligh. During that job I started school at Miami Dade College in Miami Fl in the field of Electronics Engineering  
which was a variety of things from coding, computer science, understanding schematics, microprocessors, analog
and digital communications and more. I finally acheived this degree in May of 2018
, during my time in school I had switch to another job and starting working for Comcast in Hialeah FL as another sales rep.
This job was a bit challenging at first because customers usually came to fight about their bills and services
but eventually I got the hang of things. In this job I really had to learn how to be a good problem solver and develop some true customer service skills. With time I knew how to sway attention to the products I wanted
the customer to purchase while fixing their issues. Im currenlty still in this job and been here for five years as of the making of this page.
</p>

<p>Hopefully that was more detailed for you than that first paragraph, right now im working on my certification on 
becoming a fully-stacked developer in the University of Miami. In my contact page you can reach me and in my 
portfolio page you can explore all the projects that I was able to create while earning my certification.
